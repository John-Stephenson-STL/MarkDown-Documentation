Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.  It's not.

<summary>Church Jokes</summary>

During an impassioned sermon about death & final judgement, the pastor said forcefully, "Each member of this church is going to die & face judgement." Glancing down at the front pew, he noticed a man with a big smile on his face.   
The minister repeated his point louder. "Each member of this church is going to die & face judgement!" The man nodded & smiled even more. This really got the preacher wound up. He pounded the pulpit emphatically when he came to the ultimatum: "Each member of this church is going to die & face judgement!!!" Though everyone else in the congregation was looking somber, the man in front continued to smile. Finally the preacher stepped off the platform, stood in front of the man & shouted, "I said each member of this church is going to die!"   
The man just grinned from ear to ear.   
After the service was over, the preacher made a beeline for the man.   
"I don't get it," the preacher said in frustration. "Whenever I said, 'Each member of this church is going to die,' your smile got bigger. Why?"   
"I'm not a member of this church," the man replied.
