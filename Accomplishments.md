# Driver Pickup <a name="driverpickup"></a>
  The driver usually arrives with his tractor trailer truck around 5 p.m.  He will pick up the pallets around 6:15.

  He will take the Gray Bag and then he'll sign the book.

# File Cabinet <a name="filecabinet"></a>
The keys are located in the accounting room.

The first drawer is where the Arrow Keys && Gas Cards should be stored.

The third drawer is for the accountables.

# MailBox <a name="mailbox"></a>
  If no one is at the Back-End desk the carriers will drop their Arrow Keys and/ or Gas Catss in the mailbox on the back-end desk.

  I rey to match the number on the back-side of the key with thw number on the carrier's route on their printed sheet.

# Outside Mailbox <a name="outsidemailbox"></a>
  Need to get the key from the Accountable room.
  Need to get a hand-scanner.  Preferably one with Internet Connection.
  Need to have a U-Cart.

  Wxit the warehouse using the door to enter the retail office.
  Turn the deadbolt so the door doesn't close preventing you from entering again.
  On the door shelf is a block of wood.  This is used to prop open the external door open when the retail office is closed.

  At the outside box, after opening, use the hand scanner to scan the bar-code.
    Just need to use the 1st option for scanning.

NOTE: Do NOT scan the bar-code before the required time.

# Mail Drop <a name="maildrop"></a>
  Whenever the scheduled time to check for mail, DON'T scan the bar code early.

# UBBM <a name="ubbm"></a>
  Under each carrier's cage is a tub possibly labeled UBBM.
  Need to stand at each carrier's cage to verify UBBM.
